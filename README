how to get it running for dummies:
 - get eclipse including the google plugin stuff (gwt 2.3.0)
 - get and setup gxt 2.2.3
 - import this project into the workspace of your choice
 - fix the project setup (maybe some absolute dirs are referenced)
 - run the shit
 - don't worry if it takes ages to load. its java+google :)
 
 build this shit:
 - run gwt compile
 - rebuild ./war/WEB-INF/lib/RunderPapa.jar from ./src dir
 - run warbuilder.xml with ant
 - deploy ./RunderPapa.war
