how to get it running for dummies:
 - get eclipse including the google plugin stuff (gwt 2.3.0)
 - import this project into the workspace of your choice
 - get and setup gxt 2.2.3
 - fix the project setup (some absolute dirs are referenced)
 - run the shit
 - don't worry if it takes ages to load. its java+google :)
